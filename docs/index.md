# PyEGRO: Python Efficient Global Robust Optimization

## Overview
**PyEGRO** is a Python library designed for solving complex engineering problems with efficient global robust optimization. It provides tools for initial design sampling, surrogate modeling, sensitivity analysis, and robust optimization.

## üîë Key Modules

### 1. **Design of Experiments**
- Advanced sampling methods:
  - **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)**
  - **Sobol Sequence**
  - **Halton Sequence**
  - Design variables and environmental variables (deterministic and stochastic).
  - Multi-dimensional and complex domains.
- Customizable sampling criteria for enhanced precision.

### 2. **Surrogate Modeling**
- Supports **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)** and **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.
- Hyperparameter optimization using [Optuna](https://optuna.org/).
- Real-time progress visualization.


### 3. **EGO for Surrogate Modeling**
- Provides multiple acquisition functions:
  - ***Expected Improvement (EI) and Boosting the Exploration term (ùúÅ-EI)***
  - ***Probability of Improvement (PI)***
  - ***Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)***
  - ***Exploration Enhanced EI (E3I)*** [<a href="#reference-1" style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;">1</a>]
  - ***Expected Improvement for Global Fit (EIGF)*** [<a href="#reference-2" style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;">2</a>]
  - ***Distance-Enhanced Gradient (CRI3)*** [<a href="#reference-3" style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;">3</a>]
- Comprehensive training configurations for surrogate models.
- Built-in visualization and performance tracking.


### 4. **Robust Optimization**
- Support techniques: **Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)** and **Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)** 
- Multi-objective Pareto solutions.
- Both direct function and surrogate-based evaluations supported.

### 5. **Sensitivity Analysis**
- **Sobol indices** for quantifying sensitivity.
- Seamless analysis with true or surrogate functions.
- Built-in visualization tools for insightful results.

### 6. **Uncertainty Quantification**
- Methods for uncertainty propagation:
  - Moment estimation.
  - Distribution analysis (PDF/CDF).
  - Visualization of Mean and Confidence bounds on surrogate model
