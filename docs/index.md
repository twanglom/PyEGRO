# PyEGRO: Python for Efficient Global Robust Optimization

## Overview
**PyEGRO** is a Python library designed for solving complex engineering problems with efficient global robust optimization. It provides tools for initial design sampling, metamodeling, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification and robust optimization.

## Key Modules

### 1. **Design of Experiments**
- Advanced sampling methods:
  - **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)**
  - **Sobol Sequence**
  - **Halton Sequence**
  - Design variables and environmental variables (deterministic and stochastic).
  - Multi-dimensional Input.
- Customizable sampling criteria for enhanced precision.

### 2. **Metamodeling**
- Supports **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) or Kriging**  and Multi-Fidelity using **Co-Kriging** metamodel

- Using **Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)** in uncertainty quntification and support in robust optimization loop

- Real-time progress visualization.


### 3. **EGO for Metamodeling**
Provides multiple acquisition functions:

  - ***Expected Improvement (EI) and Boosting the Exploration term (ùúÅ-EI)***
  - ***Exploration Enhanced EI (E3I)*** [<a href="#reference-1" style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;">1</a>]
  - ***Expected Improvement for Global Fit (EIGF)*** [<a href="#reference-2" style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;">2</a>]
  - ***Distance-Enhanced Gradient (CRI3)*** [<a href="#reference-3" style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;">3</a>]

Comprehensive training configurations for meta models and Built-in visualization and performance tracking.


### 4. **Robust Optimization**
- Support techniques: **Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)** and **Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)** 
- Able to use **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** in robust optimization loop call Two-Stage approach.
- Hyperparameter optimization using [Optuna](https://optuna.org/).
- Multi-objective Pareto solutions.
- Both direct function and surrogate-based evaluations supported.

### 5. **Global Sensitivity Analysis**
- **Sobol' indices** for quantifying sensitivity.
- Seamless analysis with true or surrogate functions.
- Built-in visualization tools for insightful results.

### 6. **Uncertainty Quantification**
- Monte Carlo Simulation methods for uncertainty propagation:
- Moment estimation.
- Distribution analysis (Kernel density function, KDF).
- Reliability and Risk Assessment
- Visualization of Mean and Confidence bounds on surrogate model (1D and 2D)
- Data logging in .csv for post-processing
